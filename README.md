# AutoFreeRice: What does it do?
It automatically "clicks" answers on FreeRice while acting like a human. It has a 1.5% chance of getting the answer wrong, in order to make it the most realisitc.

# Setting it up

First open the FreeRice [multiplication table page](https://freerice.com/categories/multiplication-table), copy the code in [auto.js](/blob/master/auto.js) and:

## With the console

Paste it into the console by clicking the console tab:

and the console tab should be active.

Then paste the code in, and the script will automatically run.



## Without the console

### Using the bookmarks bar
Copy the code into a bookmark by right clicking the bookmarks bar and clicking "Add page...". You may or may not need to open a new tab to see it. Then paste the URL in, and create it! To use it, just click it.

### Using the search bar
First type in "javascript:" and then paste the code in. **You have to _manually_ type "javascript:" out.**

## IMPORTANT:

FreeRice may prevent you from answering after some time. When you click an answer, it will not show you a green or red result. **Note that this may be because of internet.** Also, you may see a white screen. First try to go to the homepage. If it's white, then **wait, don't try to keep reloading it.** It thinks you _may_ be a bot but is not sure, and will let you keep using the application after a few minutes.

### I can't use the Multiplication Table! It won't let me click it.

Go to another category, answer a few questions, and then go back.
